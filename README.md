# Text-Summarization

Seq2Seq LSTM model implementation on GitHub" is a repository that showcases a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The code demonstrates how to build an encoder-decoder architecture for tasks such as machine translation or text generation. The repository provides a concise and efficient implementation of this powerful deep learning model.
